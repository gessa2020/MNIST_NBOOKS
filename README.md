Implementation of Mnist digit image recognition with logistic regression as well as ConVnet.

Classification problem using the MNIST Digit Dataset for handwritten digits.
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

Each imgage is labeled with a digit it represents,

Goal is to be able to classify correctly the images with their corresponding digits
